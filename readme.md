# Project Description

I single-handedly built an interactive mock interview application using Vite, React, Typescript, and the OpenAI API. The application incorporates real-time speech conversion and uses the OpenAI API to provide immediate, personalized feedback to improve interview skills, resulting in a rich, immersive user experience.

## Objectives

As a self-taught front-end developer with a passion for AI, I recognized the need for better interview preparation tools after completing a web development internship. Struggling to find user-friendly resources, I decided to use my skills to create an innovative application that makes interview preparation easier and more effective. This platform, a fusion of my web development expertise and AI interest, aims to help individuals tackle interview challenges with confidence. It's a testament to my dedication to simplifying the interview preparation process for job seekers globally.
